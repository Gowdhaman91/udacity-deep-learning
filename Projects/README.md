# projects covered under the deep learning nanodegree program

1. Build and train a Neural Network from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day.
2. Build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images and given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.
3. Generate a TV script using a recurrent neural network.
4. Compete two neural networks against each other to generate realistic faces.
5. Build a quadcopter flying agent that learns to take off, hover and land using reinforcement learning
